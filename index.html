          ## About the talk

          - We will be talking about a project of mine named ERML
          - ERML is an organization that namespaces an array of tools targeted towards the SQL community

          - It tries to fulfill a vision where you can visualize your database's ERD and RM, and generate SQL schema
          code, all from a single source
          - To meet this vision, it requires three primary components, and I will be covering them in this talk

          ## ERML - The Language

          ERML (Entity-Relationship Markup Language) is a language standard defined by me that aims to provide a
          complete solution to represent any ERD requirement, and to do that intuitively

          ## ERML - The Visualizer

          - An online ERD visualization tool that converts ERML code into SVG drawings
          - [Quick tour](http://erml-visualizer.netlify.app/)
          - With that, we achieve the first piece of the vision; The ERD Visualizer <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

          ### ERML - The DBML Compiler

          - DBML (Database Markup Language) is another language standard, set by Holistics, and it's designed to define
          and document database schemas and structures (relational models)
          - DBML has an online RM visualization tool; [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/619c7ced02cf5d186b6369c9)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          - DBML can be converted into SQL
          - ERML can hook into the DBML organization by providing a compiler to DBML, which achieves the second and
          third parts of ERML's vision: RM Visualizer and SQL schema code generator
          - An ERML-to-DBML compiler doesn't exist (yet), which moves us to the next part

        #### Growing the Palestinian's Open-source Culture

        - The computer science community of the Palestinian youth targets all of its efforts and talent into solving
        competitive programming problems. This is a good skill to have, but it's important to know when to stop, and
        start channeling this effort into more practical areas of computer science, like open-source
        - Browse open-source projects that meet your requirements, choose one, and start solving its problems
